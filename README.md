Client Project Deliverable 2: HTML Content

How the Python script works and how to run it.

Our Python script takes in athlete csv filenames, reads the data using process_athlete_data,
and then generates templated athlete pages with gen_athlete_page. Currently, we have hardcoded
two athletes to demonstrate the criteria and functionality for this deliverable. However, our
code can later be easily adapted to take in a file containing athlete csv filenames as a command line
argument in order to create more pages.
